## How It Operates

### 1. **Preface Page**

* This welcome screen provides users with a brief overview of the app. * It provides an explanation of the quiz's purpose and expectations. When the **Start** button is pressed, the user is directed to the quiz.

### 2. The Quiz Page

* One question at a time is shown.
* There is no lag between questions because they are **preloaded** (hardcoded or fetched at startup).
* The **True** or **False** buttons allow users to respond.
* The next question is loaded when you click the **Next** button after choosing an answer.
* Responses are saved for later review. The user is automatically taken to the score page when they have finished reading through the entire list of questions.

### 3. The score page

* Users are presented with their **total score** at the conclusion of the test.
* There is a **review section** beneath the score that displays:

  * Every query * The user's response
  * The right response * Whether the user answered correctly or incorrectly * This provides immediate feedback and aids in learning from errors.
* If users want to go back to the introduction page and start over, there is a functional **Exit** button.
